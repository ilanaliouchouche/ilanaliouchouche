### Welcome ! :cowboy_hat_face:
 My name is Ilan ALIOUCHOUCHE and I am currently a computer science student at the University of Paris Saclay. I am passionate about AI and hope to become a Data Scientist in the future. I also enjoy photography (IRL and "In Game"), hiking, and video games. I have some experience in several programming languages such as Java, Python, OCaml, and C/C++. 
 You can find some of my work on my GitHub page.
